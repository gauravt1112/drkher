<p>An implant is the preferred, modern method of replacing a missing tooth. It is a titanium cylinder that mimics the 'root' of a tooth. It is placed in the jawbone where it 'fuses' with the bone and thereby supports an artificial tooth crown. Thus, it forms a fixed, firm foundation (or anchor) to which one or more artificial teeth can be attached.<br>Dr Udatta Kher is regarded as one of the finest implantologists in the country. Over the years he has developed a reputation amongst peers and colleagues to perform complex dental implants surgeries with utmost ease. He maintains a practice with primary focus in this field and gets referrals from dentists from around the country. His ability to make the treatment procedure painless and rapid has earned him a lot of goodwill from his patients. Most of his practice is built on references from his patients successfully treated by him. </p>
