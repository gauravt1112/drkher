<p>An implant is the preferred, modern method of replacing a missing tooth. It is a titanium cylinder that mimics the 'root' of a tooth. It is placed in the jawbone where it 'fuses' with the bone and thereby supports an artificial tooth crown. Thus, it forms a fixed, firm foundation (or anchor) to which one or more artificial teeth can be attached.<br>Dr Udatta Kher is regarded as one of the finest implantologists in the country. Over the years he has developed a reputation amongst peers and colleagues to perform complex dental implants surgeries with utmost ease. He maintains a practice with primary focus in this field and gets referrals from dentists from around the country. His ability to make the treatment procedure painless and rapid has earned him a lot of goodwill from his patients. Most of his practice is built on references from his patients successfully treated by him. </p>

<li id="plw1" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>What is a dental implant ?</b>
<p id="plw-p1">An implant is the preferred, modern method of replacing a missing tooth.  It is a titanium cylinder that mimics the 'root' of a tooth.  It is placed in the jawbone where it 'fuses' with the bone and thereby supports an artificial tooth crown.  Thus, it forms a fixed, firm foundation (or anchor) to which one or more artificial teeth can be attached.</p></li>
<li id="plw2" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>What are the benefits of an implant ?</b>
<p id="plw-p2" style="display:none;">This is a 'fixed' method of replacing missing teeth.<br>Healthy teeth do not have to be drilled as is the case with a bridge.<br>Since implants are anchored in bone,chewing efficiency is improved.<br>Aesthetics or appearance can be restored
to a high standard.<br>Implants help to prevent further bone shrinkage after a tooth is lost.<br>Implants help to stabilize loose dentures.</p>
</li>
<li  id="plw3" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>What is the procedure for having an implant placed ?</b>
<p id="plw-p3" style="display:none;">Implant-supported artificial teeth are made in two stages:<br><br><b>The surgical stage:</b> This involves a simple surgery which is performed in the dental chair using local anaesthesia. The titanium dental implant is placed in a specially designed socket in the bone and the gums are sutured over it. It heals within the bone for a period of 2-4 months until it is ready for the next stage.<br><b>The restorative stage:</b> Once the implant has fused with the bone, an artificial tooth made by a dental laboratory is attached to it. This completes the tooth replacement process using implants.</p>
</li>
<li id="plw4" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>How painful is the treatment ?</b>
<p id="plw-p4" style="display:none;">Although placement of an implant requires surgery which conjures up images of pain in a personâ€™s mind, this surgery is simple and quick. Most patients are surprised to find that they experience only mild pain and swelling after the surgery. It is less painful than having a routine extraction or a rootcanal procedure.</p>
</li>
<li id="plw5" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>What is the success rate ?</b>
<p id="plw-p5" style="display:none;">Dental implants are considered to be the 'standard of care' in dentistry all over the world. The success rate is as high as 95% in the lower jaw and 90% in the upper jaw over a 10 year period. In statistical terms, this is higher than the long-term success rate of standard dental bridges or some root-canal procedures.<br>The factors which may compromise long-term success are poor oral hygiene, smoking and general health parameters like uncontrolled diabetes which hamper healing.</p>
</li>
<li id="plw6" style="cursor: pointer;"><b>What are 'Teeth in a day' ?</b> <b>Is it possible to get teeth fixed in a day ?</b>
<p id="plw-p6" style="display:none;">The media is replete with accounts and advertisements of teeth being fixed in a single day where there is no time lost between having a tooth pulled out and a new one put in its place.This procedure is possible in a certain cases. This has to be planned very carefully in advance and is not possible in all patients. However, most people do have a temporary replacement tooth placed after surgery so there is no 'gap' in the smile!</p>
