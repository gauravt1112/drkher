			  <p>A 28 year old female had a discolored front tooth. The tooth had undergone a root canal therapy during her childhood. Over the years it turned black in color.<br>Internal bleaching was performed using Carbamide Peroxide to restore the original color of the tooth. No crown was made. Hence the original form of the tooth was maintained.</p><br>

At a later date we will be considering implant supported fixed dentures.<br><br>Number of appointments: 2 <br><br>Time taken: 1 hour</p><br>
